Disable Text Selection

In this lab, you would have to make the give article element non-selectable using the cursor.
You would be learning about user-select property.
user-select
By default user-select value is set to auto for all userAgents (Browsers).
To make the text unselectable we have to change the value of this property to none .
This should do the trick, this will stop any users from selecting text on your web page.

Uh Oh! It doesn't work on Safari!
All the browsers by default do not support thisuser-select property to ensure cross-compatability (the features works across different browsers)
,we need to add a webkit property.
Webkit is the rendering engine used in the Safari Browser. Whereas Blink in the rendering engine used in Chromium based browsers.

Challenges:
Verify that the text is not selectable by double clicking
Verify that the text is not selectable by dragging for a selection
